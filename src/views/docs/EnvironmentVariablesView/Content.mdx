# Environment Variables

You must create custom environment variables beginning with `REACT_APP_`. Any other variables except `NODE_ENV` will be ignored to avoid accidentally exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name. Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.

> WARNING: Do not store any secrets (such as private API keys) in your React app!
> Environment variables are embedded into the build, meaning anyone can view them by inspecting your app's files.

Having access to the `NODE_ENV` is also useful for performing actions conditionally:

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  analytics.disable();
}
```
