# Getting started

Before proceeding you'll need to have the laste stabe <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com"  target="_blank">npm</a> installed on your machine.

You can use <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation" target="_blank">nvm</a> (macOS/Linux) or <a href="https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows" target="_blank">nvm-windows</a> to switch Node versions between different projects.

## Install dependencies
Open the project folder and install it's dependencies. You can use any package manager you want. We recommend <a href="https://yarnpkg.com" target="_blank">Yarn</a> or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com"  target="_blank">npm</a>.

```sh
cd project-folder
npm install
```

## Start development server

Once the installation is done, you can now run your app by running `npm start` or `yarn start`.

```sh
npm start
```

You will see something similar to:

```sh
Compiled successfully!

You can now view @devias-io/material-kit-pro-react in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.5:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
```

This runs the app in development mode. Open <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">localhost:3000</a> to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console. Since we use `ESlint` you will get detailed warnings.

## Build project files

```sh
npm run build
```

or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed.
