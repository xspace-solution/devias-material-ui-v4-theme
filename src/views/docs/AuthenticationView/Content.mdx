# Authentication

Devias Kit Pro supports 3 authentication methods: <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a>, <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth">Firebase Authentication</a>, <a href="https://jwt.io/">JSON Web Token</a>. You can switch between them at any time in a few of seconds. In our demo website we have Firebase by default, but we shipped with JWT version to allow you to start the application without having to configure the Auth0/Firebase api keys.

We've been testing multiple alternatives to support each integration easily without adding complexity to the project. We started with the concept of having all methods active at the same time under Redux with "service" utils, then we decided that is too difficult and hard to modify, and we reimplemented it using React Context API.

## How it works

Accessing dashboard pages is only possible for authenticated users. If this condition is not fulfilled, the user is redirected to a login page. To make this work we implemented the "Guard" concept from Angular. It is simply a component that wraps a route and checks for user authentication status before allowing the navigation. To find more information about guards, please visit the "Routing" page.

In the `src/App.js` (`src/App.tsx` for TS version) we have this line to specify the auth provider:

```js
import { AuthProvider } from 'src/contexts/JWTAuthContext';
```

This line imports the AuthProvider from the JSON Web Token method. In the `src/contexts` folder we have the all 3 methods.

We use this provider to wrap the app content:

```jsx
<Router history={history}>
  <AuthProvider>
    <GlobalStyles />
    <ScrollReset />
    <GoogleAnalytics />
    <CookiesNotification />
    <SettingsNotification />
    {renderRoutes(routes)}
  </AuthProvider>
</Router>
```

The reason for having the `AuthProvider` under `Router` is to allow the Auth Context to have access to router history (if needed).

Now that we have the AuthProvider, we can use the context directly by importing `useContext` from React and specifying the context that we want to use or we can use the custom hook `useAuth` from `src/hooks/useAuth.js` (`src/hooks/useAuth.ts` for TS version).

## Setup (optional)

### Auth0

To use Auth0 we need to configure the Auth0 Client first. The config object `auth0Config` can be found in `src/config.js` (`src/config.ts` for TS version).

```js
export const auth0Config = {
  client_id: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
  domain: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN
};
```

Access your Auth0 application dashboard and get your own `client_id` and `domain`. Remember to setup your Auth0 Application according the the Auth0 documentation, Single Page Application - React.

You can use the `.env` method to be able to have different keys depending on your environment (development, staging or production). If you will be using `.env`, in the `.env.example` file you have the variables that we use in our project.

This config object is being used in the `src/contexts/Auth0Context.js` (`src/contexts/Auth0Context.tsx` for Ts version) to initialise a new Auth0 Client.

### Firebase

To use Firebase we need to configure the Firebase SDK first. The config object `firebaseConfig` can be found in `src/config.js` (`src/config.ts` for TS version).

```js
export const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  appId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
  authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  databaseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
};
```
Go to your Firebase Console to find your project keys.

This config object is being used in `src/lib/firebase.js` (`src/lib/firebase.ts` for TS version). This is the file that initilises the Firebase application that we use for authentication.

## Switching between auth methods

The shipped project version uses by default the JWT method, but if you want to switch to Auth0 or Firebase after setup part, all you have to do is to update 2 import paths to specify the provider and it's done.

Open `src/App.js` (`src/App.tsx` for TS version) and update the following line:

```js
import { AuthProvider } from 'src/contexts/JWTAuthContext';
```

to use `Auth0Context` or `FirebaseAuthContext`.

Example:

import { AuthProvider } from 'src/contexts/Auth0Context';

Now open `src/hooks/useAuth.js` (`src/hooks/useAuth.ts` for TS version) and do the same by updating this line:

```js
import AuthContext from 'src/contexts/JWTAuthContext';
```

to use `Auth0Context` or `FirebaseAuthContext`.

Example:

```js
import AuthContext from 'src/contexts/Auth0Context';
```

## Important

If you switch to Auth0 or FirebaseAuth and the app does not load, this could mean that you forgot to setup the Firebase or Auth0 config objects.
